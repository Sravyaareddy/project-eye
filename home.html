<h3 class="headings">A Glance At the problem</h3>
<p class="para">It is estimated that currently there are 45 million individuals worldwide who are bilaterally blind and another 135 million that have severely impaired vision in both eyes (Source: WHO). The fact that there are 180 million people in the world today who are in some way severely visually disabled is an unacceptable problem. In a study it is estimated that nearly 4.9 million people suffer from corneal blindness and are looking for eye donations across the world and with a significant demand in India as well. (Source: The National Center for Biotechnology Information, Indian Journal of Ophthalmology).

In India as many as 1.1 million people suffer from Corneal Blindness (Source: Eye Banks Association of India) and can be benefited from eye transplantation. Corneal blindness is a major cause of blindness worldwide, next to cataract. The current transplantation scale is minimal in India which is approximately 28000. (Source: Eye Banks Association Of India ) as compared to the demand for the same. In fulfilling the need of these individuals we aim to campaign for eye donations. The initiative is unique in a sense that we are using web application software platform and networking concepts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the current campaigning system by eye banks, eye hospitals and associations in India.
</p> 
<h3 class="headings">The Solution</h3>
<p class="para">The platform to campaign for the initiative is through a web application platform where  campaigners are invited to register to campaign for eye donations among their social and professional network. The campaigning procedure is automated where eye pledge registrations happens through driving visitors to the registry (website platform) via various sources.

People willing to be a donor but do not want to be a volunteer for campaigning can also register / pledge and data will be maintained on the software platform without any fee. The donations collected from companies through the CSR initiatives, Grants and others sources are the sources of funds for Campaigning, Maintaining the software platform and eye transplant surgeries.

<p class="para">
Donated eyes can be used to restore vision in people who are suffering from corneal blindness. The front, clear and transparent tissue of the eye called as cornea can be used to restore vision in a corneal blind person. The other portions of the eye are also used for research and training purposes to develop cures for some of the common eye diseases.
From each pair of donated eyes, two blind people will get vision and light in to their life, thus making it more divine.


Eye donation is an act of donating one’s eyes after his/her death. It is an act of charity, purely for the benefit of the society and is totally voluntary. The eye donation of the deceased can be authorized by the next of kith & kin even if the deceased did not pledge to donate his / her eyes before death. Age or systemic illness such as diabetes or hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease is not barriers for eye donations. The corneas of a person are unaffected even if they have undergone any eye surgeries in the past and hence will be useful can be transplanted in others.

There are wide spread social awareness programs and activities conducted across the country to impart the significance of eye donation and its usefulness to the visually impaired people. Till date, medical researchers and scientists are working on developing artificial cornea, but till that time, donating the eyes would be the best gift ever for a blind person suffering from corneal blindness.
</p>
<h3 class="headings">How To Become a Donor?</h3>
<p class="para">Eye donors can be any age group,

People who use spectacles, short sightedness, long sightedness or astigmatism or even those operated for cataract can still donate, as these conditions may not affect the cornea

Patients who are diabetics, those suffering from hypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also donate eyes.
